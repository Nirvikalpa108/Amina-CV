# Amina Adewusi CV

## Summary
Amina started her coding journey in October 2018 as she wanted to learn something new whilst on maternity leave. She discovered a love for web development and a particular interest in the backend. She loves logical reasoning, solving problems and self taught learning. She is a proud open source warrier, who would like to kiss the feet of all GitHub employees. She is primarily a remote worker and aims to become a fully fledged backend engineer.

## Coding
**Courses**

*Code First Girls Beginners Frontend Course* at Entrepreneur First, London - this is an evening course taught over 8 weeks, which includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap and Git.

*Code Academy Ruby* - an online course teaching an introduction to Ruby.

**Pet projects**

[RainyDay](https://github.com/Nirvikalpa108/RainyDay) - a little web app which shows you the weather in London today and what to wear on your cycle commute! Amina's first project ever and a real joy! 

[HeadtoTail](https://github.com/versatilese16/verSAtile/tree/master) - Code First Girls team project. We are in the process of creating a website profiling pet accessories.

Forthcoming - my next project will be how to split the costs of something with one or more people. First I want to build the code which allows two people, with different spending amounts to split the total between them and know how much each owes the other. Then, I want to scale this to include more than two people and perhaps varying % shares of total costs. This is inspired by the app, Splitwise.

**Conferences/events**

* Rails Girls Workshop
* HalfStack London

**Achievements**

In November, I set up a what's app group for women teaching themselves how to code in London. We are holding our first meetup in the New Year.

## Paid work

I have been working for myself (as a director of my own limited company) since 2016. I've primarily worked for the UK's Department for International Development where I'm responsible for monitoring HMRC's investment into a new education company. I've also done projects for a private equity fund and an international NGO.

Prior to working for myself, I worked as a private equity funds investor for the UK's development finance institution and I was an economist for an investment bank focusing on FX and bonds.
